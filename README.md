### Project Description: McDonald's Database Management System

**Objective:**
The project aims to design and implement a relational database management system (RDBMS) for McDonald's. This system will help manage data for employees, stores, products, customers, and orders, allowing for efficient tracking of sales, employee management, and customer interactions.

**Scope:**
The McDonald's database consists of several interrelated tables. These tables store information regarding employees, stores, products, customers, and orders. The database will provide a structured way to manage relationships among these entities, ensuring data consistency and enabling complex queries for management reporting.

**Components:**
1. **Employee Table:** Stores details of employees, including their ID, name, position, salary, and store assignment.
2. **Store Table:** Records information about different store locations, including store IDs, locations, and the managers assigned to each store.
3. **Product Table:** Maintains the details of the products sold, including product names, prices, and categories (e.g., burger, sides, beverages).
4. **Customer Table:** Contains customer information, such as names and phone numbers.
5. **Order Table:** Tracks orders placed by customers, including the order date, total amount, and the employee handling the order.
6. **OrderDetails Table:** Contains information about the specific products ordered, their quantities, and their association with a specific order.

**Features:**
- **Data Integrity:** The database enforces referential integrity through the use of foreign keys and cascading updates and deletes.
- **Manager Assignment:** Each store is associated with a manager from the employee table, allowing easy tracking of management responsibilities.
- **Order Management:** The system efficiently records orders, with links to both the customer and employee involved in the transaction, as well as the details of the products purchased.
- **Product Management:** The product catalog is categorized, and product prices are stored in a way that allows flexibility in updating and querying product data.

**Use Case:**
The database is designed to support operational needs, such as generating reports on employee performance, sales by location, and customer purchasing behavior. The data can also be used for further analytical processing to understand product trends and customer preferences.



This database is a foundational system that can be expanded as the needs of McDonald's grow, ensuring scalability and flexibility in managing operations across multiple locations.
